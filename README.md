**UBHEX** (User Behavior Heuristic Examiner) is a PowerShell script designed to analyze user activity by aggregating data from multiple sources on a Windows machine. It helps in understanding user activity patterns over a specified period, providing insights into typical active times, durations, and other behavioral metrics. This tool is particularly useful for cybersecurity professionals, including red team operators, who aim to schedule activities during typical user active periods to blend in with normal behavior and avoid detection.
